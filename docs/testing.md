# In-game testing checklist

Run `make run`, press F5 for the console. Run `devcommands` once per session only where vanilla cheat commands are needed (Jötunn commands such as `ip_state` work without it). Update this file per plan.

## Plan 1 – skeleton
- [x] Log shows `InvisibilityPotion 0.1.0 loaded` and `Patch health: … 0 missing`
- [x] `make run` lands in the world `testing` without touching the menu
- [x] `ip_state` prints patched targets and `missing: none`
- [x] Release build (`make package`) contains no `ip_state` command and no auto-join

## Test matrix (from the spec, filled in from plan 2 on)

| Setup | Tier I | Tier II | Tier III |
|---|---|---|---|
| Singleplayer | | | |
| Self-hosted, I am host | | | |
| Dedicated, I own the zone | | | |
| Dedicated, another player owns the zone | | | |
| Player joins while I am hidden | | | |

## Plan 2 – Tier III hidden from other players

Singleplayer (checkable now):
- [ ] `ip_give 3`, then `ip_state` prints `hiddenFromPlayers=True`; after the effect ends or a reveal it prints `False`
- [ ] Log shows `Patch health: … 0 missing` with `EnemyHud.TestShow`, `ZNet.UpdatePlayerList`, `ZDOMan.SendZDOs` patched, and no `SendZDOs transpiler: pattern not found` error

Two clients (pending, needs plan 3 server):
- [ ] Second client: no nameplate over the hidden player
- [ ] Second client: no map pin for the hidden player (even with "share position" on)
- [ ] Second client: the hidden player is not rendered near their real position while hidden
- [ ] After a reveal or the end of the effect, the player appears on the second client within one send interval
- [ ] AI in the second client's zone still ignores the hidden player
- [ ] With `AllowPvpInvisibility = false` on the server, tier III hides from enemies only
- [ ] T3 drink vfx is visible to others once at the drinking spot (intended)

## Plan 2 – Round C: veil look tuning (Debug console)

Per-tier defaults: T1 fog light (density 0.35), body Off; T2 body Ghost + fog dense (0.7); T3 body Distortion, no fog. Config: `[TierN] BodyVeilMode/FogEnabled/FogDensity` (admin), look in `[Fog]` and `[Veil]` (local, not synced).

- `ip_fog` prints the fog look; `ip_fog <rate|size|life|speed|alpha|drift> <v>`, `ip_fog color r g b`, `ip_fog alphamode both|material|vertex`, `ip_fog anchor <Head|Chest|Hips|LeftHand|RightHand|LeftFoot|RightFoot> on|off|radius <v>|offset x y z`; `ip_fog save` writes `[Fog]`, `ip_fog reset` re-reads the file. Every change re-applies at once.
- `ip_veil` prints per-tier modes; `ip_veil <none|cutoff|hide|tint|ghost|distortion> [tier]` overrides your current tier (none = Off), `ip_veil off [tier|all]` clears; `ip_veil look distortion <strength> [alpha]`, `ip_veil look ghost <alpha> [emission]`, `ip_veil save` writes `[Veil]`.
- Log lines `veil ghost/distortion/fog: material ... properties: ...` list the shader properties once; report them if a value has no visible effect.
- [ ] T1: thin wisps on head, chest, hips, hands, feet; no glowing sphere
- [ ] T2: ghost body plus denser fog, clearly different from T3
- [ ] T3: distortion without blue tint, nearly invisible; no fog
- [ ] Drinking a potion plays the mead sound/particles; the end of the effect plays the stop effect
- [ ] Listen host: a remote T3 player is not drawn at their real position
